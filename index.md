# Introduction

The advanced artifical intelligience (AI) research has opened a new door for many real world applications. 
One of the most exciting breakthrough is on reinforcement learning (RL) based techniques, which enable
agents to gain intelligient decision making abiltiy to deal with real-world tasks. 
Within the scheme of RL, the agents draws a trajectory from the environment by recursively taking an action
and observing a new states then collects rewards from the trajectory. RL allows agents to learn from this kind of interaction to gain maximum cumulative reward.

The contrable apparatues in intelligient transportation system (ITS) appear in a vast number and are distributed in a wide
geographic area, which provides a promising research and application area to develop RL techniques.
In this project, we want to demonstrate the performance of RL based techniques in transit control domain.
In particular we want to advaocate the potential of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to improve the efficiency of transit system.
